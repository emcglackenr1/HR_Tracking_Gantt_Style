# HR_Tracking_Gantt_Style

  
>Making a HR Tracking page in the style of a Gantt chart. Using SCSS and JS. 

>Based on the [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) design [Gantt Chart](https://codepen.io/mbbillz/pen/YZRKZM) by [mbbillz](https://codepen.io/mbbillz)

Currently in the process of making a CSS version, testing locally. Compiled options using tools such as [beautifytools](https://beautifytools.com/) didn't produce the best results. 

**Version 1:**  

> This was how the page appeared after adapting the design from Codepen to be published via Github pages, using original SCSS
